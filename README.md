 Project Setup and Configuration
Setting up a robust web application involves leveraging various tools and resources. Below is an overview of key components and practices in the development process.
...
Tools Needed:
To facilitate development and streamline workflows, the following tools are essential:

Visual Studio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for building, debugging, and deploying applications.

SQL Server: Relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing and managing application data.

Project Resources:
Project resources encompass assets and files crucial to the application's functionality. This includes:

Static Files: Resources like images, stylesheets, and client-side scripts reside in the wwwroot directory.

Views: Razor views, marked with the .cshtml extension, define the user interface using the Razor syntax.

Dependency Injection:
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling between components. In ASP.NET, DI is facilitated through the built-in IServiceCollection and AddScoped, AddTransient, and AddSingleton methods for registering services.

`csharp`

`services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();` in program cs if not working in .net 8 create `builder.Service` then use scop or var builder.Service = service
Hot Reload:
Hot Reload is a development feature that enables real-time code changes without restarting the application. It boosts developer productivity by providing an instantaneous feedback loop during development.

using this in Program.cs in Client-Side :
            `.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation();` with package install CLI `dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation --version 8.0.0` or install in Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager


Launchsettings and appsettings.json:
Launchsettings: Configuration file (launchsettings.json) defines profiles for launching the application. It includes settings like environment variables and command-line arguments.

**appsettings.json**: *Central configuration file containing application settings, such as database connections and external service configurations*.

Routing Overview in Razor:
Razor Pages utilize a routing system for mapping URLs to corresponding pages. The @page directive in a Razor Page specifies its route.

*csharp*

`@page "/example"`
Tag Helper:
Tag Helpers in Razor simplify HTML syntax and enable server-side code within HTML markup. They improve readability and maintainability.

<!-- Example of a tag helper in Razor -->
<a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>
SQL Server:
SQL Server is a powerful relational database management system. Connection strings in appsettings.json configure the application to connect to SQL Server.

You Need Download this:
          links:    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads (create databse) with https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16#download-ssms (see your tables what do you make it)

`"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB(default);Database=MyDatabase(default)" // maybe not work try this Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;TrustServerCertificate=True you can also use encrypt then you should use username: and password: to enter your site
}`
Incorporating these tools and practices into your ASP.NET project sets the foundation for a well-structured and efficient web application development process.


and other tools in WWWROOT folder is free to use also you can find in Google or npmjs etc...
also you have to config you key with SeedGrid and Stripe setting and useing TestMode config in *appsettings.json*
